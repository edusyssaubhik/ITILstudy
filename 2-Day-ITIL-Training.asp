       <p>The ITIL Simulation in our ITILstudy Foundation course helps delegates to relate the ITIL concepts learned in class to a practical scenario. Implementation of ITIL in organizations requires a good understanding of the underlying concepts – and there is no better way to accelerate that understanding than to experience it. ITILstudy’s ITIL Simulation provides delegates a way to think through, discuss, plan and implement ITIL in their professional life, irrespective of the industry they belong to.
