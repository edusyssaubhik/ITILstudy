                <p class="Header">ITIL Intermediate Course</p>
                <p>
                ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup>is the most widely accepted approach to IT service management in the world. ITIL provides a cohesive set of best practice, drawn from the public and private sectors internationally.<br><br>
IT Service Management (ITSM) derives enormous benefits from a best practice approach. Because ITSM is driven both by technology and the huge range of organisational environments in which it operates, it is in a state of constant evolution. Best practice, based on expert advice and input from ITIL users is both current and practical, combining the latest thinking with sound, common sense guidance.

                <p class="Header">Course Description</p>
               This course provides comprehensive training for anyone involved in provision, support, and delivery of IT Services. It is accredited by, and follows the syllabus specified by the APM Group (<a href="http://www.apmgroup.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.apmgroup.co.uk/</a>).<br><br>
The ITIL Intermediate Qualification: Continual Service Improvement Certificate is a free-standing qualification, but is also part of the ITIL Intermediate Lifecycle stream, and one of the modules that leads to the ITIL Expert in IT Service Management Certificate. The purpose of this training module and the associated exam and certificate is, respectively, to impart, test, and validate the knowledge on industry practices in Service Management as documented in the ITIL Continual Service Improvement publication.
<br><br>

The ITIL® Framework is a source of good practice in service management. ITIL® is used by organisations world-wide to establish and improve capabilities in service management. Service Management is a set of specialised organisational capabilities for providing value to customers in the form of services. The capabilities take the form of functions and processes for managing services over a lifecycle, with specializations in strategy, design, transition, operation, and continual improvement. The capabilities represent a service organisation's capacity, competency, and confidence for action. The act of transforming resources into valuable services is at the core of service management. Without these capabilities, a service organisation is merely a bundle of resources that by itself has relatively low intrinsic value for customers.<br /><br />
