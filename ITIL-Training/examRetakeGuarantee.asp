                <p>Why is ITILstudy’s Money back Guarantee "THE BEST" in the industry? Compare our Money back policy with that of competitors and evaluate for yourself. </p>
                <p>We guarantee that you will be successful in your ITIL Foundation Exam after classroom training offered by ITILstudy- or we will pay for your retake exam and refund back your balance as per our Money back policy.</p>
                     
                <p class="Header"> Policy</p>
                 <p>As per our Money back policy you are  allowed to retake the ITIL Foundation exam if you fail the first attempt.
