You  have invited the IT<br />
  Senior Management Team to a meeting to discuss the scope for an  assessment to establish a baseline for future comparison and improvement. This  assessment is the starting point in an attempt to identify why the various  business units within the Organization believe that IT is not responding to their  needs, while IT believes the opposite.</p>
<p>During the meeting, it becomes obvious there are differences of opinion  among the various managers concerning the scope for the assessment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>One group  believes that the assessment should cover only the Service Management processes</li>
  <li>Another is of  the opinion that the assessment should cover people, process and technology</li>
  <li>The remainder  believe that a full assessment covering all aspects of IT is required</li>
</ul>
<p>Considerations  discussed to identify the correct scope for the assessment include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The majority  of the IT infrastructure is less than two years old and is causing no apparent  issues</li>
  <li>There is  limited cooperation between the various IT groups</li>
  <li>Nearly three  quarters of the IT staff have been with the organization for more than 15 years</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the managers (who have achieved ITIL Foundation certification)  believe that they are the appropriate ones to conduct the assessment; however,  others feel this is not necessary or relevant to the exercise.

Although the technology is less than two years old, incidents may arise, changes are happening and the business is complaining about IT’s responsiveness.

Expending the extra effort for a full assessment ensures that all areas that    will be improved in the future already have a baseline to start measuring    from. Such an assessment should cover the processes; the technologies used to    support and enable the processes, management reporting, people’s skills, and    the culture of the organization. </p></td>
