  Knowledge Management is now seen as an absolute requirement since there  are underlying support issues that could be rectified with its introduction.<br>
  Currently, customers and users log service requests or report Incidents  by calling the Service Desk or completing standard online forms from a self-service  menu.<br>
  There is no formal Change Advisory Board in existence, but each Business  Unit authorizes their own<br>
  Changes, and informal, but good service release records are kept within  each Unit. The process of<br>
  Service Portfolio Management is healthy and includes a 12 month advance  window known for future service needs.<br>
  To assist you in your task, you have been briefed about the following  issues within the Organization that require improvement:


  <ul>
    <li>There is a  lack of conformance to process across the Organization, which the Service  Transition</li>
    <li>Manager  believes could be addressed if all process documentation was held in a single</li>
    <li>Knowledge  Management repository</li>
    <li>There is no  consistency of reporting, and it appears that this leads to a lot of  duplication of effort</li>
    <li>When new  regulations are needed, introducing them across the organization seems to take  a long time, and is often costly</li>
    <li>Although the  Configuration Management System is accurate, there is not full usage of it  across the organization</li>
    <li>You believe  you need to consider the following additional opportunities:</li>
    <li>A review of  the Self Service Menu</li>
    <li>Provision of  Board reports for the Executives</li>
    <li>Storage of all  the regulatory standards</li>
    <li>Wide but  controlled access for the Service Release records and Service Portfolio  information.</li>
  </ul>
You have produced a Service Improvement Plan with the Service Transition  Manager and are now considering the information items you need to populate in a  Service Knowledge Management System that would improve the quality of decision-making.

The details of all process documentation and regulatory standards need to be stored in the SKMS to allow easy access. Service Portfolio information and Service Release records can be populated in the SKMS, but with controlled access. Executive Board reports will be far easier to produce and be more accurate if the supporting information is maintained in the SKMS. All self-service Menus also need to be transported into the SKMS, which will improve functionality for the customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=C></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> It is necessary to hold details of all central records for consistency of information, and to prevent duplication. This will include the process documentation, all Service Release records and any minutes from meetings such as Service Reviews and the Change Advisory Board. It is not necessary to hold the CMS in the SKMS as it can stand alone, but there does need to be some communication to all teams to ensure its widespread usage. There is clearly an issue with reporting at present so this needs addressing so that the Executive Board reports and general reports can be produced.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">4 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=D></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">It would be appropriate to hold details of all process documentation and regulatory standards in the SKMS so that people within IT have easy access to the required standards. It would also be useful to hold the Service Portfolio and Service Release records in the SKMS, but with controlled access. The current CMS needs to be linked to the SKMS. By presenting all the information in a single SKMS, the production of reports will be more effective, preventing duplication and controlling the level of accuracy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr>
