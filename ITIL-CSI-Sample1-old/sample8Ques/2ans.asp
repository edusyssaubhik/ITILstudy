This requires the Company to have a robust Business Continuity Plan  which must be regularly tested and updated it if any issues are identified.<br>
  The power generation products of the Company must be managed very  carefully as disruptions in production or quality can pose risks to public  safety. The head of the Business Continuity<br>
  Management (BCM) department is therefore concerned about the on-going  assurance that risks are managed appropriately to ensure that the organization  can continue operating without disruption to its critical business services,  which were identified in the Business Impact Analysis.<br>
  The IT Service Continuity (ITSC) Manager has been working in the field  of ITSC for the last 15 years.<br>
  Within this organization, the processes and procedures are all clearly  defined, organized, and maintained. When BCM or ITSC testing is carried out, it  is normal for the tests to work well and for the staff involved to be able to  perform their role. The Business Continuity Manager and IT Service<br>
  Continuity Manager are  not only old friends, but work together well.

CSI can assess the results of any Risk Management activities and Business Continuity Management (BCM) or IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM) test results to identify potential service improvements (such as risk mitigation measures). This will also serve to enhance the on-going assurance that the critical business services are covered in the event of a disaster.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 2 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> You should assess the relationship between the IT Service Continuity Manager and the Business Continuity Manager, as personal relationships could have a detrimental effect on the quality of work. You should also check whether Risk Management activities are conducted during the Design phase of the Service Lifecycle, as the Managers should not wait to review the critical business services until they are live.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 3 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> You can contribute most effectively by participating in the annual ITSCM process review that the IT Service Continuity (ITSC) Manager has developed, and provide feedback on any improvement efforts identified. You should produce a complimentary report that identifies any errors, omissions, incompleteness and where you believe there are any further improvement opportunities for BCM.

      <p>CSI cannot be done in isolation. It requires a great deal of information    from varied sources. The inspiration for this question can be found in    section 5.6.3 of the CSI book. This question is about identifying risk and    managing them. It does not matter that things are currently going well. Risks    have to be anticipated. </p></td>

    <td width="45" valign="top"><p>A</p></td>
    <td width="402" valign="top"><p>This is the correct answer. ITSCM is largely about mitigating    potential risk which from CSI perspective, should be continually assessed. A    well-functioning BCM plan alone, does not ensure that additional risks might    now be present that did not exist before and so CSI must have a role to help    ensure it is integrated with the ITSCM process. CSI can be crucial to areas    in this scenario such as identification of risks, probability of occurrence,    mitigating actions, roles and responsibilities, etc. </p></td>

    <td width="402" valign="top"><p>This is partially correct. Providing baselines and benchmarking    information is of course correct but it is incomplete. Simply Providing    baselines and information on industry best practice serves no purpose. In    this situation The CSI manager is doing his/her job. </p></td>

    <td width="402" valign="top"><p>This answer is only partially correct. This is a rather weak answer as    the contribution is limited to reports. Of course, someone must review    documents but this is not really the only contribution that CSI can make to    the process. The CSI manager should provide data, analysis, and    recommendations. </p></td>

The answer serves to distract the    candidate by questioning the relationship of the Business Continuity Manager    and the IT Service Continuity Manager.
