The Business has traditionally seen ISD as a necessary but troublesome  department.<br>
  As the Continual Service Improvement (CSI) Manager for ISD Support, you  are trying to develop an appropriate service measurement framework that will  support good decision-making at the strategic, tactical, and operational  levels.<br>
  Historically, ISD has been fairly successful at component-level  monitoring and measuring, but you know that this is no longer good enough. The  business is demanding measurements that they can relate to and ISD managers are  being pressed by the CIO to improve the way their groups are operating. Some  Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are in place, but not all the targets defined  are actively measured.
