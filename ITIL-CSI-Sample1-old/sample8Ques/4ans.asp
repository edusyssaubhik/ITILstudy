The Head of IT is accountable to ensure that IT governance underpins enterprise governance. Although it is understood that governance impacts all parts of the IT organization, the Head of IT has set up a meeting with you, the CSI leader, and others, to discuss the matter. As part of the discussion, you are required to explain if any of the best practice frameworks such as ITIL or COBIT (Controlled Objectives for IT) would be beneficial to the IT governance initiative.
ITIL has been adopted enthusiastically within the IT department, although no consideration has been given to other frameworks such as COBIT. Auditors have regularly given favourable feedback on the maturity of the ITIL processes and have highlighted the fact that the technology is very well measured and managed across all of IT.

ITIL will provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to the design, implementation, and ongoing operation of IT services. The enthusiasm for ITIL and the results of the audits suggest that IT is acting in a way that will satisfy the business and therefore if all future improvements are assessed for their support of the business needs and alignment to governance guidelines; IT will be underpinning the enterprise governance requirements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 2 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> One of the focus areas of COBIT as an IT governance framework is to support the Organization’s vision and goals and help prioritize where IT should focus its efforts in improving service provision to support the Business vision. COBIT is a high-level view of what is required and should be supplemented by ITIL, which can give more detail on how to meet those requirements. Both of these frameworks have their focus on the delivery of quality services. Each framework has qualities that would benefit the IT governance initiative; COBIT deals with what should be governed and ITIL deals with how it should be governed. Ideally, both should be used in the IT Organization.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 3 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> Much time and effort has been focused on ITIL so far, the results of the audits show that this is not working, as there is still a technology focus – which does not support the business. Success from an IT governance perspective requires consideration of an IT governance framework such as COBIT. As this initiative requires a focus on governance, COBIT should now be adopted as the Organization’s best practice framework. As there is a lot of common ground in the processes each describe, the need for ITIL will reduce but not disappear.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 4 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">COBIT and ITIL are external best practices. Governance requires that internal best practices be set up in such a manner that IT supports the business. There will still be a place for COBIT and ITIL within the Service Management part of IT; however, they will not help to improve the Organization’s IT governance. As all organizations are different in the way they are set up, governance needs to come from the upper management and describe the manner in which staff will act to carry out their duties. Governance will be defined by the policies and standards set by upper management – which in turn will define the culture of the Organization.</font></td></tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td</tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" " colspan="2"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Correct Choice : B</font></td> </tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Justification : </font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

    <td width="402" valign="top"><p>This answer recognizes that the best way to solve the issue is a    combination of the two frameworks. Each will help in its own way – but    together they are a powerful combination.<br>
      The correct way to use COBIT is to allow it to define “What” and then to use<br>
      ITIL to define “How,” this comes over well in the answer.<br>
      The answer also recognizes the fact that a business vision and goals    are important to governance. </p></td>
