Business recipients of the Service Reports are struggling to  understand the reports. They feel the language in the reports is confusing and  inconsistent. They claim this makes it difficult for them to quantify the quality  of the service received as well as to understand any improvements efforts.<br>
  The IT Service Manager is frustrated to hear this feedback. When Service  Reporting was being planned, IT and the Business agreed on a reporting policy  that included:
<ul>
  <li>The target  audiences</li>
  <li>Reporting  Schedules</li>
  <li>What to  measure and what to report on</li>
  <li>Ensuring the  reports are tied back to Service Level Agreements (SLAs).</li>
  <li>Business  access to the reports and the best medium to be used</li>
  <li>Meetings to be  scheduled to review and discuss the Reports</li>
  <li>They also  agreed on a reporting template to use. This template included the following  business focused reports:</li>
  <li>Title page  with highlights of Incident and Problem success stories, improvements that have  been implemented and risks that have been mitigated.</li>
  <li>Service Level  Agreement Red Amber Green Chart – which outlines all of the SLA breaches, near  misses and most importantly to show success, when targets are met. This report  is the main focus which is used as the primary business indicator of IT quality  IT services.</li>
  <li>Current  Incident Volumes by IT Department – This report shows, at a glance, which areas  are experiencing the most Incident volumes.</li>
  <li>Current  Problem Volumes – This report shows the integration between Incident Volumes  and</li>
  <li>Problem  volumes</li>
  <li>Incidents  attributed to Change – This report is the most used report by IT, and is often  used as evidence</li>
</ul>
As new services are launched, the SLAs are added to the existing report  template.<br>
  The Chief Information Officer has advised the IT Service Manager that IT  must quickly address the Business complaint.

Stick with the existing SLA Charts to avoid statistical ambiguity. Keep  the existing cross reference data already provided as it is currently in  alignment with existing SLAs.
