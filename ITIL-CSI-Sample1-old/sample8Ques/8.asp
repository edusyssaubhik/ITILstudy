Much thought and planning has been carried out and  detailed plans are in place to ensure the right people will be involved in  building and testing the CSI process activities prior to their implementation.  Focus has been given to all aspects of improvement such as the people, process  and technology.<br>
  To complete the plan, you asked the CSI Manager for a list of the risks  to monitor along with mitigation actions where necessary for the successful  operation of the CSI processes.<br>
  The following list was provided by the CSI Manager:
<ul>
  <li>Not discussing  improvements with the business:</li>
  <li>Improvement  opportunities need to be discussed with the Business. It is important to  identify the most appropriate service opportunities with them, and then  internally with IT to identify the key</li>
  <li>Service  Management processes which need to be improved. Also, consideration needs to be  given to understanding new business requirements for IT service provisioning.</li>
  <li>Being  over-ambitious:</li>
  <li>All CSI  activities should be prioritized for implementation</li>
  <li>Ignoring some  steps:</li>
  <li>All steps in  the 7-Step Improvement process must be followed, missing any one can lead to  poor decisions being made in subsequent steps</li>
  <li>Unbalanced  approach</li>
  <li>Not focusing  on both service improvements and process improvements.</li>
  <li>The list  provides a good start, however you need a more complete list of risks.</li>
</ul>

<li>Lack of  communication:
<br/>
A communications and awareness campaign needs to be  applied consistently across all areas of CSI so that the whole team is aware of  what is going on. It is important that the options (such as team briefs,  newsletters, news board items and e-mail communication) around delivery of the  communication are assessed for its benefit
</li>
  <li>No allocation of  activities:<br/>
Consideration needs to be given to which resources  will carry out the activities for the implementation of CSI and they need to  have allocated time as part of their normal role to achieve this</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">2 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=B></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> <ul TYPE="DISC">
<li>Implementing without knowledge transfer:
<br/>
The implementation of CSI needs to consider appropriate knowledge transfer and training to the right audiences, and should be done as close to the launch of improvement as possible. In addition general communication and awareness of the improvement needs to be factored in to ensure there is an all-around awareness of the plan for CSI
</li>
  <li>No dedicated resources<br/>
Consideration needs to be applied to appointing dedicated staff to the CSI process and also ensuring additional resources can be allocated as required for CSI activities</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=C></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> <ul TYPE="DISC">
<li>No resource reviews
<br/>
The roles of the people within the day-to-day operational support teams need to be reviewed to see which people have some flexibility to allow them time to carry out the required activities in relation to CSI
</li>
  <li>Lack of integration with other projects<br/>
A review of all project management activity needs to be performed in order to assess the resource requirements for any of the improvement activities that could have an impact on future projects. There may even be some circumstances whereby the continual improvement activity can be combined with the project for successful delivery</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">4 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=D></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><ul TYPE="DISC">
<li>Lack of a common CSI vision
<br/>
Before the planning of CSI can take place, it is vital that the vision of the CSI activity is considered. This will allow a greater chance of success for any cost justifications to Senior Management that may be needed as part of the activity
</li>
  <li>Lack of supporting technologies<br/>
The use of tools is lacking within the organization. The requirements for the tool should be reviewed as an urgent activity before any CSI activity can take place as it is going to be difficult to get any baseline data that will be used for comparison purposes later on.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr>
