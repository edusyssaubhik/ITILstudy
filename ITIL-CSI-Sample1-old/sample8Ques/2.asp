This requires the Company to have a robust Business Continuity Plan  which must be regularly tested and updated it if any issues are identified.<br>
  The power generation products of the Company must be managed very  carefully as disruptions in production or quality can pose risks to public  safety. The head of the Business Continuity<br>
  Management (BCM) department is therefore concerned about the on-going  assurance that risks are managed appropriately to ensure that the organization  can continue operating without disruption to its critical business services,  which were identified in the Business Impact Analysis.<br>
  The IT Service Continuity (ITSC) Manager has been working in the field  of ITSC for the last 15 years.<br>
  Within this organization, the processes and procedures are all clearly  defined, organized, and maintained. When BCM or ITSC testing is carried out, it  is normal for the tests to work well and for the staff involved to be able to  perform their role. The Business Continuity Manager and IT Service<br>
  Continuity Manager are  not only old friends, but work together well.

CSI can assess the results of any Risk Management activities and Business Continuity Management (BCM) or IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM) test results to identify potential service improvements (such as risk mitigation measures). This will also serve to enhance the on-going assurance that the critical business services are covered in the event of a disaster.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">2 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=B></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> You should assess the relationship between the IT Service Continuity Manager and the Business Continuity Manager, as personal relationships could have a detrimental effect on the quality of work. You should also check whether Risk Management activities are conducted during the Design phase of the Service Lifecycle, as the Managers should not wait to review the critical business services until they are live.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=C></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> You can contribute most effectively by participating in the annual ITSCM process review that the IT Service Continuity (ITSC) Manager has developed, and provide feedback on any improvement efforts identified. You should produce a complimentary report that identifies any errors, omissions, incompleteness and where you believe there are any further improvement opportunities for BCM. This will assure the business they are adequately covered in the event of a disaster.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">4 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=D></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">You need to assess the current procedures that the ITSC Manager has already developed and is using.
