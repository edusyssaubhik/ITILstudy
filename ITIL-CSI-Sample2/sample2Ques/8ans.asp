Much thought has been given to the planning of this and detailed plans are now  in place to ensure that the right people will be involved in building and  testing the CSI process activities prior to their implementation. Specific  attention has been given to role definitions, process design, and technology  selection.
<p>To complete  the plans, the chief information officer (CIO) has asked the CSI manager for a  list of the risks which will need monitoring, along with mitigation actions  where necessary for the successful operation of CSI.</p>
The following  list was provided by the CSI manager:
<ul>
 <li> Not discussing improvements with the business: <br>
  Improvement  opportunities need to be discussed with the business. It is important to  identify the most appropriate service opportunities with the business and then,  internally with IT, identify the key service management processes which need to  be improved. Also, consideration needs to be given to understanding new  business requirements for IT service provisioning </li><br>
  <li>Being over-ambitious:<br>
  All CSI  activities should be prioritized for implementation</li><br>
  <li>Ignoring some steps:<br>
  All steps in  the seven-step improvement process must be followed; missing any one can lead  to poor decisions being made in subsequent steps</li><br>
<li> Unbalanced approach:<br>
  Not focusing  on both service improvements and process improvements.<br>
  The list  provided is a good start; however, a more complete list of risks is needed.</li>

 <li> Lack of communication:<br>
  A  communications and awareness campaign should be applied consistently across all  areas of CSI so that the whole team is aware of what is going on. It is  important that the options for delivering communications (e.g. team briefs,  newsletters, news board items and e-mail communication) are assessed for their  benefits</li><br>
 <li> No allocation of activities:<br>
  Consideration  should be given as to which resources will carry out the activities for the  implementation of CSI. These resources will need to have time allocated as part  of their normal role in order to achieve this. </li>

 <li>Implementing without knowledge transfer:<br>
  The  implementation of CSI should consider appropriate knowledge transfer and  training to the right audiences, and should be done as close to the launch of  improvement as possible. In addition, general communication and awareness of  the improvement will need to be factored in to ensure there is an all-round  awareness of the plan for CSI </li><br>
 <li> No dedicated resources:<br>
  Consideration  should be applied to appointing dedicated staff to the CSI process and also  ensuring additional resources can be allocated as required for CSI activities. </li>

 <li>No resource reviews:<br>
  The roles of  the people within the day-to-day operational support teams should be reviewed  to see which people have the flexibility to allow them time to carry out the  required activities in relation to CSI</li><br>
 <li> Lack of integration with other projects:<br>
  A review of  all project management activities needs to be performed in order to assess  whether the resource requirements for any of the improvement activities could  have an impact on future projects. There may even be some circumstances wherein  the continual improvement activity can be combined with the project for  successful delivery </li>

 <li>Lack of a common CSI vision:<br>
  Before the  planning of CSI can take place, it is vital that the vision of the CSI activity  is considered. This will ensure a greater chance of success for any cost  justifications made to senior management which may be needed as part of the  activity</li><br>
 <li> Lack of supporting technologies:<br>
  The use of  tools is lacking within the company. The requirements for the tool should be  reviewed as an urgent activity before any CSI activity takes place, as it is  will be difficult to get any baseline data to use for comparison purposes later  on. </li>
