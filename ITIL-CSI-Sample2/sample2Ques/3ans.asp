All the IS unit heads report to the chief information officer (CIO). The  business has traditionally seen IS as a necessary but troublesome organization.
<p>As the continual  service improvement (CSI) manager for the support unit, you are trying to  develop an appropriate service measurement framework which will support good  decision-making at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels.</p>
<p>Historically,  IS has been fairly successful at component-level monitoring and measuring, but  you know that this is no longer good enough. The business is demanding  measurements that they can relate to, and IS managers are being pressed by the  CIO to improve the way their groups are operating. Some service level  agreements (SLAs) are in place, but not all the targets defined are actively  measured.</p></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> In addition to  the ongoing monitoring and measuring of the components of the IT  infrastructure, which one of the following options <strong>BEST </strong>represents the  additional elements you should include as part of a service measurement  framework which will support the current and evolving needs of the business?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">You should ensure that the framework measures end-to-end services, service management processes, and information services (IS) employee productivity. Measuring these things will not only allow you to present the information that the business wants but will also allow IS management to bring their people and processes under the right kind of scrutiny. The business will be concerned with end-to-end service measurements, as these reflect what they are experiencing.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 2 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> You should ensure that the framework measures end-to-end services, service management processes, and outputs.
