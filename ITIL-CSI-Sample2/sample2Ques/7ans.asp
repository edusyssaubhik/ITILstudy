Knowledge management is now seen as an absolute requirement, since  there are underlying support issues that could be rectified with its  introduction.
<p>Currently,  customers and users log service requests or report incidents by calling the  service desk or completing standard online forms from a self-service menu.</p>
<p>There is no  formal change advisory board in existence, however each business unit  authorizes their own changes and informal, but good, service release records  are kept within each unit. The process of service portfolio management is  healthy and includes a 12 month advance window for future service needs.</p>
To assist you  in your task, you have been briefed about the following issues within the  company that require improvement:
<ul>
 <li> There is a lack of conformance to process across the  company which the service transition manager believes could be addressed if all  process documentation was held in a single knowledge management repository</li>
 <li>There is no consistency of reporting and it appears  that this leads to a lot of duplication of effort</li>
 <li> When new regulations are needed, introducing them  across the company seems to take a long time and is often costly</li>
 <li> Although the configuration management system is  accurate, there is not full usage of it across the company.</li>
 </ul>
You believe  that you need to consider the following additional opportunities:
<ul>
 <li> A review of the self-service menu</li>
 <li> Provision of board reports for the executives</li>
 <li> Storage of all the regulatory standards</li>
 <li> Wide, but controlled, access for the service release records  and service portfolio information.</li>
 </ul>
You have produced a  service improvement plan with the service transition manager and are now  considering the information items needed to populate a service knowledge  management system that would improve the quality of decision-making.<br/></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of  the following options contains the <strong>BEST </strong>items for inclusion in the  service knowledge management system (SKMS) to address the issues the company is  facing?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">It is necessary to include all the configuration management databases (CMDBs) that individual teams are holding when populating the configuration management system (CMS) and SKMS.
