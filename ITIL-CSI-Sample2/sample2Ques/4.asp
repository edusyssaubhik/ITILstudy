The head of IT  is accountable for ensuring that governance of IT underpins the overarching  enterprise governance.<br>
  Although it is  understood that governance has an impact on all parts of the IT department, the  head of<br>
  IT has set up  a meeting with you, the continual service improvement (CSI) manager, and  others, to discuss the matter. As part of the discussion, you are required to  explain whether any of the best practice frameworks such as ITIL or Control  OBjectives for Information and related Technology<br>
  (COBIT) would  be beneficial to the enterprise governance initiative.</p>
ITIL has been adopted  enthusiastically within the IT department, although no consideration has been  given to other frameworks such as COBIT. Auditors have regularly given  favourable feedback on the maturity of the ITIL processes and have highlighted  the fact that the technology is very well measured and managed across all of  IT.<br/></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options is the BEST description of how Control OBjectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT) and ITIL assist with corporate governance of IT?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=A></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">IT service management will be very beneficial to the governance initiative as it is best practice, and will therefore greatly assist in aligning business and IT. ITIL will provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to the design, implementation, and ongoing operation of IT services. The enthusiasm for ITIL and the results of the audits suggest that IT is acting in a way that satisfies the business and therefore, if all future improvements are assessed for their support of the business needs and alignment to governance guidelines, IT will be underpinning the enterprise governance requirements.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">2 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=B></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> One of the focus areas of COBIT as an IT governance framework is to support the company's vision and goals, and help prioritize where IT should focus its efforts in improving service provision to support the business vision. COBIT is a high-level view of what is required and should be supplemented by ITIL, which can give more detail on how to meet those requirements. Both of these frameworks focus on the delivery of quality services. Each framework has qualities that would benefit the governance initiative; COBIT deals with what should be governed and ITIL deals with how it should be governed. Ideally, both should be used in the IT department.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=C></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> Much time and effort has been focused on ITIL and, so far, the results of the audits show that this is not working, as there is still a technology focus which does not support the business. Success from an IT governance perspective requires consideration of an IT governance framework such as COBIT.
As this initiative requires a focus on governance, COBIT should now be adopted as the company's best practice framework. As there is a lot of common ground in the processes each describe, the need for ITIL reduces but does not disappear.

Governance requires that internal best practices be set up in such a manner that IT supports the business. There will still be a place for COBIT and ITIL within the service management part of IT; however, they will not help to improve the company's governance of IT. As all companies are different in the way they are set up, governance needs to come from the upper management and describe the manner in which staff will act to carry out their duties. Governance will be defined by the policies and standards set by upper management  which in turn will define the culture of the company.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr>
