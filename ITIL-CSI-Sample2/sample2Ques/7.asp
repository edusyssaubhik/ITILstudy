Knowledge management is now seen as an absolute requirement, since  there are underlying support issues that could be rectified with its  introduction.
<p>Currently,  customers and users log service requests or report incidents by calling the  service desk or completing standard online forms from a self-service menu.</p>
<p>There is no  formal change advisory board in existence, however each business unit  authorizes their own changes and informal, but good, service release records  are kept within each unit. The process of service portfolio management is  healthy and includes a 12 month advance window for future service needs.</p>
To assist you  in your task, you have been briefed about the following issues within the  company that require improvement:
<ul>
 <li> There is a lack of conformance to process across the  company which the service transition manager believes could be addressed if all  process documentation was held in a single knowledge management repository</li>
 <li>There is no consistency of reporting and it appears  that this leads to a lot of duplication of effort</li>
 <li> When new regulations are needed, introducing them  across the company seems to take a long time and is often costly</li>
 <li> Although the configuration management system is  accurate, there is not full usage of it across the company.</li>
 </ul>
You believe  that you need to consider the following additional opportunities:
<ul>
 <li> A review of the self-service menu</li>
 <li> Provision of board reports for the executives</li>
 <li> Storage of all the regulatory standards</li>
 <li> Wide, but controlled, access for the service release records  and service portfolio information.</li>
 </ul>
You have produced a  service improvement plan with the service transition manager and are now  considering the information items needed to populate a service knowledge  management system that would improve the quality of decision-making.<br/></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of  the following options contains the <strong>BEST </strong>items for inclusion in the  service knowledge management system (SKMS) to address the issues the company is  facing?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=A></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">It is necessary to include all the configuration management databases (CMDBs) that individual teams are holding when populating the configuration management system (CMS) and SKMS.

Service portfolio information and service release records can be populated in the SKMS, but with controlled access. Executive board reports will be far easier to produce and be more accurate if the supporting information is maintained in the SKMS. All self-service menus also need to be transported into the SKMS, which will improve functionality for the customers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=C></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> It is necessary to hold details of all central records in the SKMS for consistency of information, and to prevent duplication. This will include the process documentation, all service release records and any minutes from meetings such as service reviews and the CAB. It is not necessary to hold the CMS in the SKMS as it can stand alone, but there does need to be some communication to all teams to ensure its widespread usage. There is clearly an issue with reporting at present and this needs addressing so that the executive board reports and general reports can be produced.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">4 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=D></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">It would be appropriate to hold details of all process documentation and regulatory standards in the SKMS so that people within IT have easy access to the required standards.

By presenting all the information in a single SKMS, the production of reports will be more effective, preventing duplication and controlling the level of accuracy.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr>
