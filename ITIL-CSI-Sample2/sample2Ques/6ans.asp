Business  recipients of the service reports are struggling to understand them. They feel  the language in the reports is confusing and inconsistent. They claim this  makes it difficult for them to quantify the quality of the service received as  well as to understand any improvement efforts.</p>
The IT service  manager is frustrated to hear this feedback. When service reporting was being  planned, IT and the business agreed on a reporting policy that included:
<ul>
 <li> Details of the target audiences</li>
 <li> Reporting schedules</li>
 <li> Details of what to measure and what to report on</li>
 <li> Confirmation that the reports are tied back to service  level agreements (SLAs).</li>
 <li> Details of who will have access to the reports, and  the best medium to be used</li>
 <li> The scheduling of meetings to review and discuss the  reports.</li>
</ul>
They also  agreed on a reporting template to use. This template included the  following  business focused reports:
<ul>
 <li> Title page with highlights of incident and problem  success stories, improvements that have been implemented, and risks that have  been mitigated</li>
 <li> Service level agreement red amber green chart  this  report outlines all of the SLA breaches, near misses and, most importantly,  shows success when targets are met. This report is used as the primary business  indicator of quality of IT services</li>
 <li> Current incident volumes by IT department  this  report shows, at a glance, which areas are experiencing the most incident  volumes</li>
 <li> Current problem volumes  this report shows the  integration between incident volumes and problem volumes</li>
 <li> Incidents attributed to change  this report is the  report most used by IT, and is often used as evidence</li>
</ul>
<p>As new  services are launched, the SLAs are added to the existing report template.<br/>
The chief  information officer has advised the IT service manager that IT must quickly  address the business complaint.</p>

Improve the  report package to include a more meaningful summary section which outlines the successes  and failures, and how IT has handled them. Cross-reference data which is  already provided; ensure, however, that it is aligned with contracted or  chargeable items of service delivery and add historical representation of past  periods performance as well as current trends and threats.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 2 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> <ul>

Stick with the existing service level agreement (SLA) charts to avoid statistical ambiguity.
