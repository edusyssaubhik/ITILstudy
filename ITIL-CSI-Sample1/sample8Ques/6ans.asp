Benchmarking is the only way to open an organization to new methods, ideas and tools in order to improve its effectiveness. Benchmarking will reduce the resistance to change by demonstrating other methods of solving problems than the one currently employed, and demonstrating that these are far better as they are being used successfully by other companies.
