Unfortunately, the IT organization has not scaled its growth to meet the needs  of the new business circumstances, resulting in a very reactive service  management culture. The business does not appear to understand or value IT.<br>
  In order to  show the business the contribution that IT is making to the company, some basic  reporting has been developed, mostly around the service desk and key system  availability. There is reporting capability in the areas of network and server  availability but the concept of end-to-end service reporting is not  well-understood.<br>
  A new chief  information officer (CIO) has been employed who is an advocate of process and  objectives measurement.<br>
  As the new  continual service improvement (CSI) manager, you are tasked with creating a  continual improvement culture in the company with solid monitoring and  measuring practices. You plan to introduce the ITIL seven-step improvement  process to the company. You recognize, however, that previous efforts have  stalled shortly after they began, as the IT team has a tendency to see  continual improvement as a short-term initiative.<br>
  The CIO is  enthusiastic about implementing a robust process for CSI that will provide  ongoing value, but also requires that some immediate benefits be realized. </p></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options is the BEST way to begin introducing the continual service improvement (CSI) process for maximum benefit?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=A></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">Work with the chief information officer (CIO) and other management leaders to identify and verify the vision, along with the strategic, tactical, and operational goals. This will give a focus to the seven-step improvement process, particularly in the area of defining what you should measure.
In parallel, begin an audit of your current measurement capabilities and an awareness campaign to communicate the value of CSI. In collaboration with each business unit, identify the top five problematic areas and address any quick wins to gain support. This comprehensive approach will serve to gain adoption.

You then need to design the CSI processes, hire staff, and start an awareness campaign to communicate the benefits. You will also need to change the culture within IT to ensure success. The CIO needs to fund full-time staff members to the project. Without all of these elements, any effort will be short-term and will not allow for cultural adoption of CSI.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=C></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> Share the seven-step improvement process with IT managers and advise them that they can apply the process to their respective areas. Work with each manager to analyse the data currently being collected within their respective area. Prepare a report for each area and, as a group, identify as many improvements as possible that can be made in the short-term. Meet with the CIO to ensure commitment to these improvement efforts and to assist in the prioritization. Ensure that improvements implemented by each manager are publicized to the company to raise visibility and build support for the ongoing effort.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">4 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=D></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">Work with the CIO and key stakeholders to identify one problematic area that needs improvement and use this as a pilot with a small group which you will educate on the CSI processes. Identify the appropriate vision, mission and goals, and work through the seven steps to define what should be measured to meet these goals. Define what can be measured based on an audit of your current capabilities, and then gather process, analyse, present and use the data and resulting information to implement corrective action. Use this pilot to market the value to the company and gain support going forward.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr>
