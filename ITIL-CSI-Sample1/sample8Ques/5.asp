Although service quality reports are regularly generated and presented  to the business, the reports don't seem to be changing the business  behaviours, nor does the business seem to recognize how much of an effort the  IT organization is now making to communicate these real and positive results.  Continual service improvement (CSI) has now been initiated as part of a larger  service quality programme. A strong education and awareness program has been  conducted to make sure stakeholders at all levels in the company are aware of  the CSI efforts and their potential value to the company.</p>
<p>As the CSI  manager, you have indicated to the rest of the service quality programme team  that there are three main target audiences that must be reached with seven-step  improvement process information: the business, the IT management team, and the  remainder of the IT organization engaged in the daily work of running the IT  departments.<br/><br/>
While you feel that good  progress has been made in many areas, you are still of the opinion that  interactions with the business need to be improved further.</p></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options BEST describes how to improve the communication and engagement with the business?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=A></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">Review the way service quality information is currently being presented, looking specifically for the relevance of the presentation method to the interests and concerns of the business, and how well that information is eliciting co-operation and desired behaviours.

Look for reports or sections that no one in the business seems to be interested in and stop providing them; it is unlikely that there will be any impact. Consider whether or not the messages intended from the reports are clear to the business and revise them as necessary. This will improve the relationships with the business immediately.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=C></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> In co-operation with the service level manager, review the way information is currently being presented.

Review the detail of the reports with them to be sure they understand the meaning of each report. Explain how IT captures and processes the information and how the recommendations will help the business. Then advise the business what action items are expected from them based on this information. Advise the business that SLA commitments are being consistently met now, so IT needs the business to work with them on the next improvement steps.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr>
