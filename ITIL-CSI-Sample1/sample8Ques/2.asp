The company has won  numerous awards. There is a growing interest in going international. The company  recently showed their products at various trade shows in Europe and the  Americas.<br>
  The head  office employs about 75 people, seven of them in IT. There is currently only  one manufacturing plant, which employs 200 people and which has experienced  difficulty keeping production in line with demand. The company must now expand  both locally and abroad, and so has recently announced the following business  strategies:
  <ul>
  <li>Streamline business operations to reduce the  bottlenecks impeding the launch of new products</li>
  <li>Concentrate on increasing the market share of key  products by eliminating the manufacturing of products that are not selling well</li>
  <li>Improve production capacity and capabilities by moving  to new production sites in Europe and the Americas</li>
  </ul>
  The chief information  officer (CIO) wishes to increase the awareness and acceptance of a continual  service improvement (CSI) approach amongst IT staff. The CIO believes that the  continual service improvement programme will lead to closer integration between  IT and the business. You have recently been appointed as the CSI manager.<br>
  Previously a  SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis was conducted  by a selection of staff from the IT team. This was intended as input to the IT  strategy that is about to be developed, part of which included a SWOT analysis  of continual service improvement within the company.<br>
  The results of  the SWOT analysis are shown below.</p><br/><br/>
