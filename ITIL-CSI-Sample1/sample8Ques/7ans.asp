Availability  management is currently done at the component level (network, and server  monitoring), but there is no end-to-end service monitoring. This is seen as a  key requirement as there is a customer perception gap between what is published  in the monthly availability reports and the end user experiences.<br/><br/>
A new service  management tool has recently been purchased. An incident management process is  in place and configuration item data is captured at the incident logging stage  within the tool. Use is made of reports from the change management process to  identify where there has been an impact on services. There are some alerts  being generated to the technical teams through event management, both during  and outside of business hours.<br/><br/>
Even though the  budget available is limited, the IT director requires that there be some data  analysis done which is capable of capturing the end-to-end service  availability. This will enable IT to act upon performance deficiencies and to  facilitate a real demonstration of IT service improvement.</p></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options is the BEST action to take to identify which technology to implement across your IT organization?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">There is a desire to produce end-to-end service performance data fairly quickly to demonstrate responsiveness to the business. However, you are concerned about incurring further expenditure on unnecessary tools. As the incident management process is reasonably well established, you feel it is acceptable to instigate a manual calculation based on the high priority incidents logged, as these are the ones that cause the most problems for the business. You will then be able to use this information to calculate the downtime of the service, and hence work out service availability.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 2 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> Effort should be applied to the tool already purchased to assess whether its functionality is capable of providing the required data to calculate end-to-end service availability. This will minimize the need to apply further additional expenditure on the tool. The toolâ€™s functionality should be based on the operational activities of the seven-step improvement process, and provide monitoring at each level of the service by service, systems and components, as well as support the reporting requirements for service level agreements, operational level agreements and underpinning contracts.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 3 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> It is important that the investments currently made in the software tools, such as the alerting tools and the new service management product, are fully integrated to ensure the organization receives end-to-end information quickly. To achieve this it is also vitally important that the configuration data is kept up-to-date. Understanding what can be measured will give a good starting point from which to progress. Information gained from the event tool and the incident records will allow an end-to-end availability level to be calculated that should satisfy the business need at minimal cost.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 4 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">Many software vendors in the market provide tools that are compatible with the ITIL process framework. As the current tools are not providing the required information, further investment is required to provide a more suitable tool capable of giving the business a true picture of end-to-end service. As selection of the previous tools does not seem to have worked, it is recommended that improvements in tool selection process be made, in order to shortlist tools that would be suitable and therefore reduce the chance of inappropriate purchases in the future.</font></td></tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td</tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" " colspan="2"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Correct Choice : B</font></td> </tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Justification : </font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
