You are committed to ensuring that the  change management process is aligned to the business needs of your company.  Initial investigations show that the only documentation available in the  company is a change management process flowchart with no reports on process  performance produced. <br>
  Your initial  observation is that there are a high percentage of emergency changes being made  within the company (compared to what you have been used to in other companies).<br>
  Changes are  logged into a tool that has been designed and implemented in-house. Although  the database structure is sound and the information is useful, you suspect that  more changes are made than are actually recorded.</p>
<p>You extract  some data for analysis that confirms your suspicion about emergency changes.<br>

While gathering this information there will be time to gauge the customers and ITs perception of the process. This can then be compared to the current process documentation, with any differences found being prioritized. You will need to educate people on the reasons for compliance with the process and to implement some quick wins. Looking at Table 1, you suspect that people do not have the same understanding of the change categorizations so you need to include business impact and urgency to help set priority.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 3 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"> You need to apply the continual service improvement model and understand Where are we now?ù From Table 1, the current position indicates around 20% of changes are prioritized as emergency changes. These changes will increase the risk to the organization and the level needs to be reduced to below 5%. You need to decide how to achieve this. This may include activities such as defining what constitutes an emergency change and the setting up of an emergency change advisory board (ECAB). Once these improvements have been made, you need to measure the level of emergency changes to see if the objectives have been met. Once they have been met then further improvement can be considered.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</font></td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width=" "><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 4 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">As you are new in the post, it would not be a good idea to rush immediately into improvements.
The level of emergency changes will settle, as it has been coming down over the last five periods. However, the tool used to log changes has been built in-house and is probably not sufficient for a change management process that will be aligned to ITIL best practice. You should therefore, look for a replacement so that you are working with quality data. Simply changing the tool will not guarantee its use, so you should talk with everyone to ensure that they will record every change.
