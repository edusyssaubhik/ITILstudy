You report to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and reporting to you are the  Development Teams, the Project and Programme Management Team, the IT Operations  Teams including the Data Centre Manager, and the Continual Service Improvement  Team.
<p>In order to  update the services and to position the company for the commercial challenges  ahead, it has been agreed at Board level that the infrastructure will be  redesigned and the current 20 systems migrated and consolidated onto a single  new service. This new service will greatly reduce IT operating costs for both  manpower and technology, and will enable the business divisions to radically restructure  their operating capability.</p>
<p>The  Transformation Programme started three months ago, is still in the planning  phase and has only just received final sign-off from the Board. Resources are  currently being identified and engaged to join the Programme team, the  communication plan is being developed, and the Programme risks, assumptions and  constraints are being refined. No detailed design has yet been undertaken, and  the overall Programme is expected to last two years.</p>

    <td width="51" valign="top"><p>C</p></td>
    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This option represents the most correct answer as it highlights that    the Programme is of significant impact to the services provided to current customers.</p>
      <p>Given that the IT Service Manager is the main sponsor, it is important    that he/she attends the meeting to make their support and commitment to the<br>
        Programme visible.</p>
      <p>This option also identifies the important of recognizing that IT    Operations staff need to be involved during the planning phases of the    Programme, rather than after the solution has been developed, tested and    ready for Operations. The Programme sponsor is actually verifying that this    is the case by requesting to<br>
        look at the list of invitees to the meeting.</p>
      <p>This option also highlights the importance of risk assessment and management,    It shows that the sponsor will look at and signoff on the identified risks,    on the Programme’s assumptions and constraints, resourcing (shows commitment)    and costs or funding (again demonstrates commitment). </p></td>

    <td width="51" valign="top"><p>A</p></td>
    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This difference between this answer and the best answer is that it    implies that the sponsor may have the tendency to micro-manage the Programme,    as he wants to know in detail and exactly what is going on. </p>
      <p>This is unrealistic as this is one of several projects they may have    to oversee. This option also does not accurately highlight the significant    level of impact this Programme will have on services provided to the    customers. </p></td>

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This option is providing a less accurate answer to the previous    option. It does not highlight the important of making the sponsor’s support    visible by attending the meeting in person. It also shows the sponsor as satisfied    just being copied on the meeting’s minutes, and “may wish to be included at a    later date”, hence<br>
      showing less interest about the Programme </p></td>

    <td width="51" valign="top"><p>B</p></td>
    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This option demonstrates a total relaxed approach by the sponsor of    the Programme. It shows the sponsor has a lack of interest in the early    stages of the Programme, during which the main decisions need to be made and    buy-in achieved. The sponsor’s actions do not demonstrate a committed or supporting    attitude towards the Programme, which could be copied by his direct reports    and programme team members. There seems to also be a lack<br>
      of interest from the sponsor in making sure that the right parties be    involved in the programme from the beginning. </p></td>
