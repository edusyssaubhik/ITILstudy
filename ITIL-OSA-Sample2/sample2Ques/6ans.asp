The Company is heavily dependent on their IT Department which develops  specialized in-house solutions for them. Several times in the past, these  solutions provided a clear strategic advantage over their competition and for  this reason BCB has kept a high level of specialized experts on staff. BDB is  also<br>
  using a  standard Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and a standard desktop  software package and has acquired a high level of expertise in supporting these  services.
<p>ITIL best  practices have been implemented within the Company and most of the processes  are considered effective and efficient. The Problem Management process is owned  by the Service Desk. It is perceived as being very effective because it managed  to solve 103 out of 104 identified Problems last year, with the mean time for  solving a Problem being 5 days. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are also in  place and are actively used. The quality of service, together with the highly respected  SLAs, has built IT a solid reputation within the company.</p>
<p>For these  reasons, the CIO is particularly shocked about recent user complaints that the  number of Incidents is continually increasing and has reached an unacceptable  level. You have been asked you to look into the situation and to make a  proposal for the best way forward.<br>
  After analysing  the Incident reports from the last three years, you find that the number of  Incidents has doubled to over 300,000 per year. In the same period the number  of users has increased by just 12 percent. You also note that there appear to  be 2000 Incidents of the same type for the ERP system.</p>
Last year, the  Service Desk was able to solve 81percent of all Incidents immediately while the  users were on the phone. The users only suffered 29 Major Incidents and all  were solved inside the agreed resolution times. In fact, over 98 percent of all  Incidents were solved inside of agreed SLA resolution times.<br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following actions BEST describe what the CIO should do regarding the user complaints?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">As the statistics show clearly that IT support is functioning optimally no actions are required at this time.
