A  particular question has come up regarding the retention of data relating to  Events that occur.
<p>All people  involved have agreed that Events that are classified as ‘Warning’ or  ‘Exception’ need to be retained for a lengthy period after the event has been  dealt with. However, concerns regarding the amount of space that will be  required and the volume of data to be stored and potentially accessed, have  caused some senior technical staff to propose that Events categorized as  ‘Informational’ need only be retained for a minimal period. A retention period  of one week has been proposed, the logic being that if any follow-up issues  have not occurred by then they are extremely unlikely to occur at all.<br>
  Other team members  have argued that this does not make sense. The data may be needed for some time  beyond this point, so should be retained indefinitely.</p>
The  organization’s legal department has advised that there may also be legislative  or compliance issues and if so the data may need to be retained for up to six  years.<br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Based on ITIL best practice, which one of the following solutions is CORRECT?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">There is a clear need for the ‘Informational’ Events to be retained.

      <p>This question focuses on data retention in relation to Event    Management and in particular Event categorization. The correct answers also    involve good discussion – in this case discussion with the business and IT    users to determine the most appropriate data retention periods for each    separate Event type, so as to best meet business needs and outcomes. </p></td>

Although    no required data will be deleted when it might still be needed, it is likely    that a lot of data will be retained long after it ceased to be required. </p></td>
