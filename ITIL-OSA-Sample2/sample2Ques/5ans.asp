The acquired companies continue to operate fairly autonomously,  each with its own IT Department; however, several corporate systems, such as  e-mail and an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, have been deployed. A  new corporate Document Management System (DMS) is in the process of being  deployed.
<p>A centralized  Service Desk provides a single point of contact for managing Incidents and the  separate IT Departments each support their own systems and also provide second  and third-line support for the corporate systems to their respective user  communities. A common set of high-level Incident Management procedures are  being followed, although each of the IT Departments is still using its own logging  and management system.</p>
<p>The Chief  Executive Officer (CEO) oversees a Chief Information Officer (CIO) Group comprised  of the CIO from each of the separate IT Departments. The CEO has challenged  this Group to identify opportunities to reduce costs, share resources, and  consolidate operational activities. The CEO is also frustrated by recent  Problems deploying the new DMS and significant outages affecting the ERP System.  To date, a lack of data gathering standards have made it difficult to  investigate and analyse these Problems. Because both of these systems are  critical to the company’s overall success, the CIO Group needs to quickly  determine why these Problems are occurring and determine ways of minimizing the  impact.</p>
Discussion is  under way to determine how to make best use of existing resources –  particularly the Technical and Application Management resources – to deal with  these issues. Each of the IT Departments is experiencing staffing shortages and  most CIOs indicate that their Technical and Application Management functions  are currently over-utilized.<br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options is the BEST approach to resolve these challenges and support the CEO’s goals?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><ul>

    <td width="490" valign="top"><p>This answer best addresses the issues in the scenario<br>
      Bullet 1 – Addresses the CEO’s goal of consolidating operational    activities. This approach will also help relieve the over-utilization of the    Technical and Application Management functions.<br>
      Bullet 2 – Addresses the need to improve data gathering standards.<br>
      Bullet 3 – Addresses the CEO’s goal of sharing resources. It also acknowledges    the need to devote resources to Problem Management.<br>
      Bullet 4 – Having a Known Error Database (KEDB) will support Problem Management    activities and help reduce the impact and cost of outages.<br>
      Bullet 5 – Addresses the need to reduce and/or prevent problems with    new services by engaging Technical and Application Management staff in    Service Design and Service Transition activities. </p></td>

    <td width="24" valign="top"><p>D</p></td>
    <td width="490" valign="top"><p>This answer is good but is lacking some specifics.<br>
      Bullet 1 – While accurate, this answer is a bit narrow in focus. Other    activities that could be delegated include backup, restore, and routine    maintenance and operational activities.<br>
      Bullet 2 – Addresses the need to improve data gathering standards.<br>
      Bullet 3 – Partially correct - logging all Incidents is important and    is the responsibility of the Service Desk. However, the Service Desk is not responsible    for logging all Problems – that is the responsibility of Technical and Application    Management via the Problem Management process.<br>
      Bullet 4 – Although this answer addresses the need to devote resources    to Problem Management it does not support the CEO’s goal of sharing resources.<br>
      Bullet 5– Having a KEDB will support Problem Management activities and    help reduce the impact of outages. </p></td>

    <td width="24" valign="top"><p>C</p></td>
    <td width="490" valign="top"><p>This answer has some merit but fails to address some of the issues    presented in the scenario.<br>
      Bullet 1 – Partially supports the CEO’s goal of consolidating    operational activities.<br>
      Bullet 2 – While accurate, this answer is a bit narrow in focus. Other    activities that could be delegated include backup, restore, and routine    maintenance and operational activities.<br>
      Bullet 3 – Having a KEDB will support Problem Management activities    and help reduce the impact of outages.<br>
      Bullet 4 – Providing users access to a KEDB is a bit premature.<br>
      Bullet 5 – While an accurate statement, involving Technical and    Application Management resources early in the service lifecycle will better    help resolve the issues in this scenario<br>
      This answer does not address devoting resources to Problem Management activities    and so does not address the CEO’s challenge to determine why problems are    occurring. Furthermore, because there are no formal Problem Management    activities, it is unlikely that the KEDB will be accurate, complete, and    current at all times. </p></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="102" valign="top"><p><strong><em>DISTRACTOR (0)</em></strong></p></td>
    <td width="24" valign="top"><p>A</p></td>
    <td width="490" valign="top"><p>This answer is incorrect.<br>
      Bullet 1 – While it may be perceived that expanding the Service Desk    will result in a cost savings, there is really nothing in the scenario to    indicate this is necessary or a priority <br>
      Bullet 2 – Partially correct - logging all Incidents is important and    is the responsibility of the Service Desk. However, without data gathering    standards, the data will not be as valuable as it could be as input to the    Problem Management process. Also, the Service Desk is not responsible for    logging all Problems – that is the responsibility of Technical and    Application Management via the Problem Management process.<br>
      Bullet 3 – It is Technical and Application Management’s responsibility    to validate and maintain the KEDB<br>
      Bullet 4 – Providing users access to the KEDB is a bit premature<br>
      Bullet 5 – While an accurate statement, involving Technical and    Application Management resources early in the service lifecycle will better    help resolve the issues in this scenario<br>
      <br>
      This answer is wrong because it does not address many of the issues in    the scenario such as consolidating operational activities and sharing    resources; It does not address devoting resources to Problem Management    activities and so does not address the CEO’s challenge to determine why    problems are occurring. It also does not address defining data gathering    standards and so it is unlikely that the KEDB will be accurate, complete, and    current at all times. </p></td>
