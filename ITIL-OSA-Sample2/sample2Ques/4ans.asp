The Project is part of a strategic corporate initiative to  streamline key business processes and better use IT to create competitive  advantage. The goals of this initiative are to:
<ul>
  <li>Reduce costs</li>
  <li>Maximize resources</li>
  <li>Improve enterprise-wide information security</li>
  <li>Ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory controls</li>
</ul>

<p>When the new  web-based services are available, varying levels of access to these services  will be granted to employees, contractors and, in some cases, select customers.  Business sponsors have emphasized that because the current market place is  extremely dynamic and competitive, it is critical that access is granted as  quickly as possible when requests are submitted. However, security is also a  concern and the Business expects IT to play a key role in securing the  organization’s information assets.</p>
A new Access  Management process has been implemented that is based on ITIL best practices. A  project is underway to clarify the procedures for creating and utilizing user  profiles to grant and manage access on an on-going basis.<br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options BEST describes how to utilize user profiles in support of business goals?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><ul>

      Bullet 1 – Having a Catalogue of roles enables Access Management to function    more efficiently and so helps reduce costs and maximize resources. Defining    roles also makes it possible to grant and restrict access more quickly as    required by the business.<br>

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer addresses most factors but lacks some needed specifics.<br>
      Bullet 1 - Having a Catalogue of roles enables Access Management to    function more efficiently and so helps reduce costs and maximize resources.    Defining roles also makes it possible to grant and restrict access more    quickly as required by the business.<br>
      Bullet 2 – Supports the business goal to function more efficiently by    defining and using “groups” to grant and restrict access.<br>
      Bullet 3 - Supports the business goal to ensure compliance with    legislative and regulatory controls.<br>
      Bullet 4 - Supports the business goal to improve enterprise-wide    information security. Also supports the business goal to reduce costs and    maximize resources by automating the granting of access.<br>
      While each of these answers is accurate, this answer fails to mention    working in conjunction with Human Resources to maintain the catalogue of    roles. As unclear roles and responsibilities is one of the challenges to be    overcome, this is not the best answer. </p></td>

    <td width="51" valign="top"><p>C</p></td>
    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer has some merit but lacks specifics.<br>
      Bullet 1 – Defining roles enables Access Management to function more efficiently    and so helps reduce costs and maximize resources. Defining roles also makes    it possible to grant and restrict access more quickly as required by the    business. This answer would be better if it suggested creating a catalogue of    roles.<br>
      Bullet 2 – This is an accurate statement but does not address the need    to work with HR to maintain the catalogue of roles.<br>
      Bullet 3 – While important, this answer fails to mention roles and responsibilities    which is a key challenge to be overcome.<br>
      Bullet 4 - Supports the business goal to reduce costs and maximize    resources by automating the granting of access.<br>
      This answer, in general, fails to clarify roles and responsibilities.    It also fails to mention engaging Security at all and so does not support a    key business goal. </p></td>

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer is wrong. It is too broad and impractical and does not    reflect ITIL guidance, nor does it support business goals.<br>
      Bullet 1 – While defining a standard set of services is appropriate,    granting access to all users is not. For example, customers and contractors    are not typically granted access to internal systems.<br>
      Bullet 2 – This answer is highly impractical and so would not support    the business goals of reducing costs and maximizing resources.<br>
      Bullet 3 – This answer incorrectly suggests using technology to grant    access based on individual needs. This would be a highly ineffective use of technology.    Using roles and groups would allow access to be granted and restricted much    more quickly, would be more cost-effective, and would be a better use of    resources.<br>
      Bullet 4 – This answer incorrectly states that Information Security    will be responsible for informing Access Management about new employees (vs.    HR).<br>
      It also does not address how to grant access to contractors and    customers.<br>
      This answer, in general, fails to support business goals and    accurately reflect ITIL guidance. It does not clarify roles and    responsibilities. It also fails to mention the need to ensure compliance with    local data protection legislation. </p></td>
