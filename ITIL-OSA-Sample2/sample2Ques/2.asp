It relies on many IT services to provide its external  customers with the ability to obtain fast and accurate quotes from the  company’s website.<br>
  It is a  dynamic company that retains a competitive advantage by responding quickly to  trends in the insurance market with new offerings to external customers. This  requires that the staff and business processes are flexible so that the company  can rapidly respond to market needs. Accordingly, the Company encourages staff  to change or share roles regularly. This results in many requests to move or  purchase IT equipment. There are also frequent requests to make changes to  system access when users change roles.
<p>You are the  Service Desk Manager and joined the company three months ago. Until now the  Service Desk has dealt with all Service Requests as Incidents. You are in the  process of planning to implement a Request Fulfilment process. The process will  be initiated by Service Desk staff and involves other support groups. Service  Requests will continue to be logged in the Incident Management system but will  be categorized as “Requests” for workflow and reporting purposes.</p>
You are analysing  the most frequently occurring Service Requests that the new process will handle  and have produced a report of some of the common calls that are received by the  Service Desk. This report is shown below:<br>
