You report to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and reporting to you are the  Development Teams, the Project and Programme Management Team, the IT Operations  Teams including the Data Centre Manager, and the Continual Service Improvement  Team.
<p>In order to  update the services and to position the company for the commercial challenges  ahead, it has been agreed at Board level that the infrastructure will be  redesigned and the current 20 systems migrated and consolidated onto a single  new service. This new service will greatly reduce IT operating costs for both  manpower and technology, and will enable the business divisions to radically restructure  their operating capability.</p>
<p>The  Transformation Programme started three months ago, is still in the planning  phase and has only just received final sign-off from the Board. Resources are  currently being identified and engaged to join the Programme team, the  communication plan is being developed, and the Programme risks, assumptions and  constraints are being refined. No detailed design has yet been undertaken, and  the overall Programme is expected to last two years.</p>
