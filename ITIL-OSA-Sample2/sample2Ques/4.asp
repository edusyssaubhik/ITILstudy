The Project is part of a strategic corporate initiative to  streamline key business processes and better use IT to create competitive  advantage. The goals of this initiative are to:
<ul>
  <li>Reduce costs</li>
  <li>Maximize resources</li>
  <li>Improve enterprise-wide information security</li>
  <li>Ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory controls</li>
</ul>

<p>When the new  web-based services are available, varying levels of access to these services  will be granted to employees, contractors and, in some cases, select customers.  Business sponsors have emphasized that because the current market place is  extremely dynamic and competitive, it is critical that access is granted as  quickly as possible when requests are submitted. However, security is also a  concern and the Business expects IT to play a key role in securing the  organizationâ€™s information assets.</p>
A new Access  Management process has been implemented that is based on ITIL best practices. A  project is underway to clarify the procedures for creating and utilizing user  profiles to grant and manage access on an on-going basis.<br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options BEST describes how to utilize user profiles in support of business goals?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=A></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><ul>
