                <p class="Header">ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup> Foundation Course</p>
                
                <p>ITIL is the most widely accepted approach to IT service management in the world. ITIL provides a cohesive set of best practice, drawn from the public and private sectors internationally.<br><br>IT Service Management (ITSM) derives enormous benefits from a best practice approach. Because ITSM is driven both by technology and the huge range of organisational environments in which it operates, it is in a state of constant evolution. Best practice, based on expert advice and input from ITIL users is both current and practical, combining the latest thinking with sound, common sense guidance.</p>
                <p class="Header">Course Description</p>
               
                <p>This course provides comprehensive first-level training for anyone involved in provision, support, and delivery of IT Services. It is accredited by, and follows the syllabus specified by the APM Group (<a href="http://www.apmgroup.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.apmgroup.co.uk/</a>).<br><br>The ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup> Foundation course culminates in an optional one-hour multiple-choice examination for the Foundation Certificate in IT Service Management and is a pre-requisite for the further training in ITIL that leads to the ITIL Diploma in IT Service Management.<br><br>The ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup> Framework is a source of good practice in service management. ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup> is used by organisations world-wide to establish and improve capabilities in service management. Service Management is a set of specialised organisational capabilities for providing value to customers in the form of services. The capabilities take the form of functions and processes for managing services over a lifecycle, with specializations in strategy, design, transition, operation, and continual improvement. The capabilities represent a service organisation's capacity, competency, and confidence for action. The act of transforming resources into valuable services is at the core of service management. Without these capabilities, a service organisation is merely a bundle of resources that by itself has relatively low intrinsic value for customers.<br><br>More information can be found at the OGC web-site: <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/office-government-commerce-ogc" target="_blank">www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk</a></p>
