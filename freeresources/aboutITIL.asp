              <h1 class="PageTitle">About ITIL<Sup>&reg;</sup></h1>
              <p>ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library<Sup>&reg;</sup>) is the most widely adopted framework for IT Service Management in the world. It is a practical approach to the identification, planning, delivery and support of IT services to the business. It describes how IT resources should be organized to deliver business value, documenting the processes, functions and roles of IT Service Management (ITSM).</p>
              <p>ITIL principles are used by a number of organizations in both the public and private sectors such as NASA, IBM, HP, British Telecom, HSBC bank, L'Oreal and many others.</p>
              <p>ITIL is created and owned by the Cabinet Office, the ITIL best practices are explained in five core guidance publications outlining the fundamental ITIL principles which focus on areas within the service management discipline.</p>
              <p>ITIL Best Practices also underpin the foundations of ISO/IEC 20000 (previously BS15000), the International Service Management Standard for organizational certification and compliance.</p>
