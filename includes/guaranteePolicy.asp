				<p>ITILstudy guarantees its classroom training (Boot-camp) delegate's success in the ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup> Certification exams. The high quality of our study materials, the expertise of our faculty, and the time-tested course delivery methodology give us this confidence. <br><br>
It is most unlikely that you will fail the exams. However, if this happens, we will allow you to sit the exam a SECOND TIME absolutely FREE OF COST.</p>

			
           <p class="Header"> Please note</p>
			<ul>	
			
				
				<li>Our Pass Guarantee policy is applicable only for our ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup> Classroom Training Programmes.</li>
                
				<li>Each and every delegate who completes our module on Pre-coursework and the assignments as required in the class can avail themselves of this Pass Guarantee policy.</li>
				
				<li>We will allow the delegates to retake the exams FOR FREE a second time if they fail on the first attempt and wish to sit the exams a second time. We will waive payment of the exam fee.</li>
				
                <li>As soon as you receive the communication from APMG, you should send a scanned copy of your exam results to 1) ITILstudy at marketing@itilstudy.com and 2) your faculty at their email address. We need this information to process our training itinerary.</li>	
                
                <li>Passing ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup> exams calls for rigorous preparation and demands 100% commitment from the delegates.</li>
                <li>You should complete the preparatory study required before attending the ITILstudy's ITIL<sup>&reg;</sup> Classroom Training programme. This is a 100% online course of a very basic nature that can be completed with a few hours of effort. You will get access to this Pre-prep course once we receive your payment. </li>
                <li>The timings of our Classroom Sessions will be from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM every day. During the sessions, you are requested to switch off your cell phones and not to take any unscheduled breaks without the permission of the faculty.</li>
                <li>Since this is a rigorous and intensive programme, you should be totally committed to exam preparation during the days of your classroom sessions. Our Pass Guarantee will not apply if you:<br> <br>
                <ul type="circle">
                <li>Come to the class late or leave early on any of the prescribed days of the training.</li>
                <li>Do not follow the instructions of the faculty and do not complete the exercises and home work as required by the programme (both during and after class hours).</li>
                 <li>Disturb others, ask irrelevant questions, cause wastage of programme time, and create a non-conducive study environment of any other kind. The faculty may in such cases ask you to leave the class and you will not qualify for availing the Pass Guarantee scheme.</li>

                </ul>

                </li>
                <li>No relaxations to this Pass Guarantee policy will be made under any circumstances.</li>
