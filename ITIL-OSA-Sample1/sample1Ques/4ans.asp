<p>The Service  Desk operates on weekdays from 08:00 through to 18:00, although the actual  business hours of the Administration Centre are 09:00 to 17:00 Monday to  Friday. When the Service Desk is closed, the Service Desk telephones divert to  the Data Centre Operations staff.</p>
You are the  Data Centre Manager and your team actively monitors the entire infrastructure,  batch scheduling, tape handling requirements, storage capacity and availability  levels. You have some software tools in place but all of the systems are  fragmented and there is no centralized database holding this information to  enable trends to be established against the patterns of business activity.</Br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> As the Data Centre Manager, which one of the following options BEST describes your requirements of the Service Desk software?
