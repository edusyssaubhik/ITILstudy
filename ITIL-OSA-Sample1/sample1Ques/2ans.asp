Participants in this  program will work at home using corporate laptops and will access corporate  systems via the Internet. Participants will commute to the corporate  Headquarters no more than once a month and will utilize designated work areas  that will be reserved in advance, much like a hotel room.
<p>An initial  pilot of the programme is in the planning stage and will involve 100 senior  employees. No more than five employees per department may participate in the  programme and participants must have at least five years of service with the  Company. It is expected that in time the programme will be expanded  considerably and may grow to include thousands of employees.</p>
<p>The corporate  Headquarters is comprised of three large buildings. Open work areas are  available in each of these buildings. Optimally, telecommuters will reserve a  work area in the building where the telecommuter’s Supervisor and team members  reside. However, telecommuters may at times have to walk from one building to  another to attend meetings, participate in training classes, and other activities.  Telecommuters will scan their corporate badge to gain access to the buildings.  They will proceed to the reserved cubicle and “check-in” using an online  reservation system called “TOffice.”</p>
<p>You represent  the Service Desk and are participating on a team that is determining what  changes must be made to the Access Management process to accommodate this new  program. The Access Management process is working well and is based on ITIL  best practices. The organization adopted ITIL more than 10 years ago and its IT  Service Management practices in general are quite mature.</p>
The team  working on this project includes representatives from Human Resources,  Information Security Management, and all of the Service Operation functions.  Following a revision of the new Information Security Policy and an initial  brainstorming session, the team is preparing to present a recommendation to  Management.</br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options is the BEST set of Access Management-related activities that must be undertaken to accommodate the telecommuter programme?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><ul>

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer best describes activities that must be undertaken to    accommodate the telecommuter program. Note that a new Information Security    Policy is referenced in the scenario and so it is not necessary to reference    it again here. Note also that Access Management is working well and so there    is no need to design or redesign the process. This question looks simply at    how to introduce a new service.</p>
      <p>• Creating a Service Request model is an appropriate trigger given the    maturity of this organization<br>
        • As all telecommuters will be granted the same set of access and    rights, adding a group is an effective way to grant and manage these    privileges<br>
        • Monitoring and Control mechanisms and measures are both extremely    important<br>
        • Working with Incident Management to resolve incidents caused by    incorrect telecommuter access settings ensures those incidents are being    tracked and resolved as quickly as possible. </p></td>

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer is good and each bullet is technically correct. It is not    the BEST answer as it does NOT refer to:</p>
      <p>• Creating a telecommuter group<br>
        • Using the Directory of Services to grant and manage access to that    group<br>
        • Producing measures </p></td>

    <td width="51" valign="top"><p>D</p></td>
    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer has some merit; however, it is missing many important considerations.    For example, it does NOT refer to:</p>
      <p>• Creating a telecommuter group (bullet 4) and granting access to all    of the applications and services telecommuters will need in addition to    TOffice. For example, they may need to be granted the right to dial in or use    Virtual Private Network (VPN) Connections.<br>
        • Producing measures<br>
        • Working with Incident Management to resolve incidents caused by incorrect    telecommuter access settings<br>
        Bullet 3 - While it is appropriate to use a Request for Change as a    trigger, particularly for large-scale service introductions, it is unlikely    that TOffice is the<br>
        only application or service telecommuters will need to access<br>
        Bullet 5 – While revoking access when a Telecommuter is terminated is important,    it is likely, given the maturity of this organization, that all access to any    and all services is revoked immediately. There are also other conditions that    may warrant revocation of telecommuter status (transfers, promotions, retirement,    etc.) and so this answer is too specific </p></td>

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer is wrong.<br>
      • Bullet 1 - The scenario indicates the Information Security Policy    has been updated. Furthermore, this activity would not be the responsibility    of Access Management.<br>
      • Bullet 2 – Access Management grants access to services in the    Service Catalogue and so it would already have been updated and SLAs would<br>
      already be in place. Furthermore, these activities would not be the responsibility    of Access Management.<br>
      • Bullet 3 - As only existing employees can participate in the    program, a user profile is not needed.  Employees would only need to be granted<br>
      access to the applications and services required by the telecommuter program<br>
      • Bullet 4 - While it is appropriate to use a Request for Change as a    trigger, particularly for large-scale service introductions, it is unlikely    that TOffice is<br>
      the only application or service telecommuters will need to access </p></td>
