Some specialized services were designed by external vendors that still  provide second and third-level support. The IT Department is currently  organized into Application and Technical Management silos, with little interaction  between teams. A recent baseline assessment uncovered the following issues:
<ul>
  <li>New systems are being commissioned without adequate training to either  support personnel or users.</li>
  <li>Some senior technical staff are performing entry level tasks while  expensive contractors, lacking the business knowledge, are hired to work on the  design of technical architecture and performance standards for new services, or  to perform applications sizing and modelling activities.</li>
  <li>Application error codes are not always traceable to the correct errors,  and some application error messages are not clearly worded.</li>
  <li>System and user documentation are not up to date.</li>
  <li>Ineffective performance and availability reporting due to inaccurate  data.</li>
  <li>There is confusion within IT regarding who is responsible for managing  the technical vendors.</li>
</ul>
A recent  customer satisfaction survey highlighted similar training, errors and  documentation-related issues.<br>
  As a result of  the assessment, Management decided that an improvement programme needs to be launched  to streamline its IT operations, reduce costs and improve its IT resource  utilization.</Br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> You are an ITIL Expert hired to help with the improvement effort.
