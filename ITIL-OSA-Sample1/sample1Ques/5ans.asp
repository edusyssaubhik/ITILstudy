The Company has made the  decision to consolidate its IT organizations into a single, Shared Services  Unit and adopt ITIL best practices.
<p>Each IT  organization handles Incidents and Service Requests through a series of loosely  defined procedures. Change Management procedures are enforced only for  significant Changes and existing service management tools range from simple  in-house developed databases to, in the case of one IT organization, a  commercially-developed Incident tracking system. Most of the Organizations have  some form of Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and a shared  Knowledgebase, and both are working well within some of the IT organizations.</p>
<p>A decision has  been made to eliminate all in-house developed systems. The team using the commercially  developed system believes its tool will work enterprise-wide if it is upgraded  to the current release, and customized with some additional capacity.</p>
<p>Management has  made it clear that whichever tool is selected, it must enable:<br>
  • Process  integration and automation capabilities<br>
  •  Implementation of a CMS<br>
  • Self-help  for users</p>
<p>Several  Managers have seen other commercial tools that will also meet the  Organization’s needs. As there is a long holiday weekend in two months’ time,  there is growing pressure to make a decision quickly and then plan to use the  upcoming holiday weekend to deploy the new system.</p>
You have been  asked to lead the ITSM program. During a staff meeting with Service Operation Managers,  you are asked to recommend the best way to proceed with selecting a service management  tool.</br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following approaches is BEST for implementing a new tool that addresses the needs of this organization?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><ul>

    <td width="51" valign="top"><p>C</p></td>
    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>• This answer best addresses both best practice guidance and the needs    of this organization.<br>
      • Despite the pressure, two months is entirely too short a period of time    for implementing a change of this magnitude. What is needed is a formal    project that will ensure requirements are determined and that the needs of    all stakeholders are considered.<br>
      • This is the only answer that stresses examining and formalizing    processes (vs. procedures) and touches on establishing a common way of    working (a phrase that is used in 8.5.4 multiple times). It also suggests    using ITIL guidance to examine and formalize the processes.<br>
      • A Statement of Requirements is a critical first step when evaluating    and selecting technology.<br>
      • A licensing structure can be used to determine the best combination    of licenses (dedicated, shared, web, etc.) needed to deploy the system in a    cost effective way.<br>
      • Funding considers not only procuring the licenses but also    deployment and on-going maintenance. </p></td>

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>• This answer is good but lacks a few specifics.<br>
      • It fails to recommend using a formal project management approach (as    prescribed in 8.2) and promoting awareness.<br>
      • While it mentions updating procedures, it fails to address the need    to examine and formalize processes before selecting a tool and establishing a    common way of working. It also mentions updating the procedures to reflect    ITIL best practice without first examining the procedures to ensure that all    best practices are appropriate to the needs of the organization.<br>
      • It mentions determining how many dedicated licenses are needed, but    fails to consider other types of licenses (e.g., shared, web, etc.) that may    enable a more cost-effective solution.<br>
      • It also fails to recommend budgeting for deployment and on-going    maintenance activities. </p></td>

    <td width="51" valign="top"><p>A</p></td>
    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>• This answer has some merit but is generally off the mark.<br>
      • Examining the existing system without first determining requirements    is a waste of time and effort. This answer also mentions ensuring the system    can support existing procedures, rather than more formalized common processes    developed using ITIL guidance.<br>
      • This answer mentions determining how many dedicated licenses are    needed, but fails to consider other types of licenses (e.g., shared, web,    etc.) that may enable a more cost-effective solution. It also fails to    recommend budgeting for deployment and on-going maintenance activities.<br>
      • Encouraging senior management to show visible support for a common    system (vs. common processes) is too weak a recommendation for a change of    this magnitude. Senior management must communicate policies and expectations    regarding process compliance in clear and meaningful ways. While this answer    may be viewed as having merit, it is off the mark in terms of its    technology-centric approach.<br>
      • Launching an awareness campaign and raising an RFC are both valid    steps. The answer fails, however, to recommend using a formal project management    approach. </p></td>
