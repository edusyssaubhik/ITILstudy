The Sales team has an expensive marketing campaign underway  and complaints have found their way to senior Management.
<p>You are the  Problem Manager and have been asked to join the meeting. You ask the analysts  to participate in a quick brainstorming session so that you can better  understand the Problem. The analysts agree that the Problem seems to be  hardware-related as the Incidents include hard drive and memory failures and  broken fans. The analysts also notice that in some cases, the PCs are repaired only  to fail again. The analysts speculate that the hard drive and memory failures  are the most frequently recurring issues.</p>
You agree to  raise a Problem record and leave the meeting to begin assembling a  Problem-solving group to investigate and diagnose the root cause.</Br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following options BEST reflects how ITIL best practices and Problem Management can be used to determine a resolution of this Problem?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#2F95D3; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Choice 1 </font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">Log the Problem and record the results of the brainstorming session in the description field.

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer correctly reflects Problem Management best practices    including logging the problem, linking it to related Incidents and recording    the results of the brainstorming session. The best practice of categorizing    the problem in the same way as Incidents is described along with using the    CMS to determine the impact of the problem and assist in diagnosing the    problem. The reference to assigning an “appropriate” priority is fine as the    fact that senior management is hearing about complaints does not necessarily    warrant the immediate assignment of a high priority. The reference to raising    a Known Error record for information purposes is appropriate guidance and the    Kepner and Tregoe stages are accurately described. </p></td>

    <td width="397" valign="top"><p>This answer has some merit but incorrectly references using “the    Problem Management coding system.” Best practice states that “Problems must be    categorized in the same way as Incidents.” Prioritizing the problem is not    referenced and this answer also fails to reference the first two Kepner and    Tregoe stages (define and describe the problem). The references to using the    CMS and raising a Known Error record are both appropriate. </p></td>
