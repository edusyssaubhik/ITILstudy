This growth  has been achieved by opening many new outlets and most significantly, by buying  three other companies in the computer games market. It has also expanded its  head office premises where a number of administrative and support services will  be centralized.
<p>The IT systems  that the original company used were basic and were not managed or supported by clearly  defined processes. The three new companies are similar, although one  specializes in internet sales which have now become a significant part of  overall business revenue.</p>
<p>The IT  Director (an employee for many years) has decided that the quality of IT  service delivery is essential in ensuring IT services support the Business’s  ambitious plans for further growth. The internet sales Company has some  expertise in ITIL and the IT Director is now convinced that ITIL is a trusted  framework which will enable the company to achieve its goals.</p>
An external  assessment has concluded that the current Incident Management process is  lacking maturity and that a good starting point would be to review the Service  Desk function and ensure commonality across the organization.</br>
