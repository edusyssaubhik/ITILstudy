The Company has made the  decision to consolidate its IT organizations into a single, Shared Services  Unit and adopt ITIL best practices.
<p>Each IT  organization handles Incidents and Service Requests through a series of loosely  defined procedures. Change Management procedures are enforced only for  significant Changes and existing service management tools range from simple  in-house developed databases to, in the case of one IT organization, a  commercially-developed Incident tracking system. Most of the Organizations have  some form of Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and a shared  Knowledgebase, and both are working well within some of the IT organizations.</p>
<p>A decision has  been made to eliminate all in-house developed systems. The team using the commercially  developed system believes its tool will work enterprise-wide if it is upgraded  to the current release, and customized with some additional capacity.</p>
<p>Management has  made it clear that whichever tool is selected, it must enable:<br>
  • Process  integration and automation capabilities<br>
  •  Implementation of a CMS<br>
  • Self-help  for users</p>
<p>Several  Managers have seen other commercial tools that will also meet the  Organization’s needs. As there is a long holiday weekend in two months’ time,  there is growing pressure to make a decision quickly and then plan to use the  upcoming holiday weekend to deploy the new system.</p>
You have been  asked to lead the ITSM program. During a staff meeting with Service Operation Managers,  you are asked to recommend the best way to proceed with selecting a service management  tool.</br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following approaches is BEST for implementing a new tool that addresses the needs of this organization?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=A></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><ul>
