In addition to  visiting the agency Branch locations, customers can book travel online or by  telephone.
<p>Both Branch and Call Centre staff rely on IT services for booking  flights,  accommodations, printing  tickets, itineraries and invoices. The Head Office deals with corporate and  administrative activities.</p>
<p>A year ago, in an attempt to improve IT services, the IT Department  introduced ITIL Service Management processes and practices. Most of the Service  Management processes have been in place for six months and there have been some  perceived improvements in the level of service.</p>
<p>During the last two months however, some complaints have been received  regarding poor levels of service from the Service Desk. These include telephone  calls not answered quickly enough and analysts taking too long to provide  first-line support. The number of complaints seems to increase whenever a new  release of the main booking system, Travel Book is deployed.</p>
<p>A major release of Travel Book is planned for next month. The Service  Desk Manager is working with the Release and Deployment Manager to improve the  support from the Service Desk during this deployment.</p>
In order to plan this support, the Release and Deployment Manager has  suggested that the Service<br>
Desk Manager reviews  reports of the relevant metrics used by the Service Desk.</br></font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width="10px"></td><td colspan="2"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><b>Question:</b> Which one of the following sets of metrics can BEST be used to determine the cause of poor support levels and plan improvements?</font><BR><BR></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=" ">&nbsp;</td><td width="7%"><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3">1 &nbsp;&nbsp; <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="SelectedChoice" VALUE=A></font></td><td><font face="Arial,sans-serif" size="3"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
